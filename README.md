### Project Description
This project presents a hilariously over-the-top solution to a very simple problem: checking the time.
Instead of displaying the time directly, our system generates a QR code. When scanned with a smartphone, the user is redirected to a web page that looks like it's straight out of a hacker‚Äôs terminal ‚Äì complete with monospace green-on-black text and dramatic aesthetic.
But here‚Äôs the twist ‚Äì upon opening the page, the current time, current date, and a Braille version of the time appear. The Braille is displayed using Unicode characters, even though Braille is meant to be felt ‚Äì making it entirely useless, yet wonderfully ironic.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
