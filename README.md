### Project Description
This project presents a hilariously over-the-top solution to a very simple problem: checking the time.
Instead of displaying the time directly, our system generates a QR code. When scanned with a smartphone, the user is redirected to a web page that looks like it's straight out of a hacker‚Äôs terminal ‚Äì complete with monospace green-on-black text and dramatic aesthetic.
But here‚Äôs the twist ‚Äì upon opening the page, the current time, current date, and a Braille version of the time appear. The Braille is displayed using Unicode characters, even though Braille is meant to be felt ‚Äì making it entirely useless, yet wonderfully ironic.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People check the time way too easily ‚Äî with clocks, phones, or even smartwatches.Where‚Äôs the effort? Clearly, what the world doesn't need is a faster way to check time‚Ä¶ it needs a QR code, a browser, a loading screen. That‚Äôs the kind of overkill this 

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Why check the time like a normal person when you can launch a full-blown cyber mission?
Our solution involves scanning a mysterious QR code that whisks you away to a webpage that looks like it was coded by a sleep-deprived hacker from the year 2099.

Once there, instead of a simple clock, you're greeted with a dramatic screen that pretends something explosive just happened. Out of the digital chaos, the current time, date, and even a Braille version (which you obviously can‚Äôt feel) emerge like survivors of a tech apocalypse.
It‚Äôs flashy. It‚Äôs confusing. It‚Äôs useless.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages used:
  HTML5 (for structure)
  CSS3 (for styling and animations)
  JavaScript (for time logic, interactivity, and effects)
- Frameworks used :
   None! This project proudly runs on raw, unfiltered web technology.
- Libraries used :
  Also none. All functionality is custom-coded ‚Äì because importing libraries would make it too useful.
- Tools used :
  QR Code Generator 
  Web Browser 
  Code editor-VS Code


### Implementation
For Software:
- Time and Date Retrieval
Uses JavaScript‚Äôs Date() object to get the current time and date, shown in both numerals and Braille Unicode.

- Dynamic Display
Opening the QR-linked page triggers a CSS animation, after which the time, date, and Braille appear dramatically.

- Styling and Aesthetic
Hacker-style green-on-black theme with monospace fonts, blinking cursors, and smooth animations.

- QR Code Integration
QR code links directly to the hosted page, auto-triggering the display on scan.

# Installation
 1. Clone the repository
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/qr-time-display.git
 2. Navigate to the project folder
 cd qr-time-display
 3. Open the HTML file in your browser
 (or host it online to use with QR code)


# Run
 1. Open the HTML file in your browser
 open index.html   # (or just double-click the file)
 2. Scan the QR code (generated earlier or provided) with your phone
 3. Enjoy the overly dramatic time, date, and Braille reveal
